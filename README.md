# A* Pathfinding System -Unity3D
- A simple and reusable implementation of A* pathfinding in Unity3D
- This project has 2 versions of A* , one for 3D and an other for 2D
- Example scenes of the use of both 2D and 3D are provided in the scenes folder ;)

## Details about the implementation :
- Editable grid size and node size 
- Requesting paths through a 'PathFinderManager' singleton
- Using threads for lesser hit on the FPS and CPU usage
